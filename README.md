# SQL-challenge

In this assignment, I researched the employees of a corporation from 1980s and 1990s.
Performed Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis from six CSV files that had the database of employees.

Data modeling
```
Inspected the CSVs and created an ERD of the tables.
```

Data Engineering
```
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files and specified types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints.
Then imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
```

Data Analysis
```
Ran multiple SQL queries to find different relationships among all the tables.
```
Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.  
Created a bar chart of average salary by title.
